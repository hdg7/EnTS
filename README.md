# EnTS

The Entropy Time Series algorithm aims to extract an entropy profile of a specific binary in order to generate a search space where a classifier can distinguish between malware and benign-ware using only the profile information. 

This repository is divided into two folder: 

- EntCalculator: Creates the Entropy Profiles and also contains a Structural Entropy implementation.
- Classifier: Classifies the profiles in different classes.

##Creating Entropy profiles

To create an entropy profile you need a configuration file, you can find an example in config.ini.

The command to create an Entropy Profile from a specific file is:
```
./EntCalculatos -i file.bin 
```
The output, depending on your configuration file, will provide you a lot of information about the original profile, the sub-profile, the wavelet and the final reconstruction. In EnTS we use the last one. If you want to create the space from a big set of files, you only need to put everything in a matrix style. I recommend you to use AWK for that:
```
awk 'FNR==1{print $1}' reconSeg* > ents.matrix
```

In the current format, ents.matrix must be class-balanced and it will be divided in 2/3 for train and 1/3 for test. Train and Test must be sorted too, in order to ensure that your test data is not contaminating your train set.

##Classification

Once you have the space I recommend you to set up the names and the classes in different files. Suppose we have all.names and all.classes with the names and the classes for malware and benign-ware. Then, we call the the classifier as follows:
```
./ents.r ents.matrix ENTS all.classes all.names
```
This generates an output and two files: ENTS.rf.roc and ENTS.rf.class. These files contains the roc curve and the individual classification of the test set.
